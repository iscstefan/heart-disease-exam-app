- - "how do i know if i have covid-19?"
  - "Most common symptoms:
     fever,
     dry cough,
     tiredness.
     Less common symptoms:
     aches and pains,
     sore throat,
     diarrhoea,
     conjunctivitis,
     headache,
     loss of taste or smell,
     a rash on skin, or discolouration of fingers or toes.
     Serious symptoms:
     difficulty breathing or shortness of breath,
     chest pain or pressure,
     loss of speech or movement.
     Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms. Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility.
     People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home.
     On average it takes 5 or 6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days."
- - "how does it spread?"
  - COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). People who are infected but do not show symptoms can also spread the virus to others. Cases of reinfection with COVID-19  have been reported but are rare. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.
    COVID-19 spreads very easily from person to person. How easily a virus spreads from person to person can vary. The virus that causes COVID-19 appears to spread more efficiently than influenza but not as efficiently as measles, which is among the most contagious viruses known to affect people.
- - "what is covid-19?"
  - COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans. Because it is a new virus, scientists are learning more each day. Although most people who have COVID-19 have mild symptoms, COVID-19 can also cause severe illness and even death. Some groups, including older adults and people who have certain underlying medical conditions, are at increased risk of severe illness.
- - "how can i prevent covid-19?"
  - "The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus.
     Wash your hands often with plain soap and water. The CDC recommends washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol. Learn more about safely using hand sanitizer.
     Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face covering or non-surgical mask when around others. Find more information about how to select, wear, and clean your mask.
     Avoid crowds and practice social distancing (stay at least 6 feet apart from others).
     Get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is offered to you."

- - "should i wear a mask?"
  - You should wear a mask whenever you are in a public place where you will encounter other people. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can spread between people interacting in close proximity — for example, speaking, coughing, sneezing, or singing— even if those people do not symptoms.
- - "can coronavirus live on objects? Mail from affected areas? Clothes?"
  - There is no evidence at present that items imported from affected areas and shipped or mailed over the course of days or weeks are spreading COVID-19. Although the new coronavirus weakens and dies over time outside of the human body, studies suggest that it can live on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days, depending on surface, temperature and other environmental factors. For instance, a small amount of the new coronavirus is still detectable on plastic surfaces for up to three days, on stainless steel for up to two days and up to one day on cardboard, but it's at less than 0.1% of the starting virus material.
- - "can i make my own hand sanitizer?"
  - There are no studies supporting the effectiveness of homemade hand sanitizer blend in killing the new coronavirus on people's hands. Experts agree that the best method for cleaning hands is washing for at least 20 seconds with soap and water.
- - "get covid-19 if i smoke cigarettes?"
  - Data shows that when compared to never smokers, cigarette smoking increases the risk of more severe illness from COVID-19, which could result in hospitalization, the need for intensive care, or even death. Smoking cigarettes can cause inflammation and cell damage throughout the body, and can weaken your immune system, making it less able to fight off disease.
- - "can i give my pet covid-19?"
  - There is a very small number of pets around the world reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 after having contact with a person with COVID-19. Based on the limited information currently available, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered low.
    Until we learn more about how this virus affects animals, treat pets as you would other human family members to protect them from a potential infection.
    Do not let pets interact with people outside the household.
    Keep cats indoors when possible to prevent them from interacting with other animals or people.
    Walk dogs on a leash, maintaining at least 6 feet (2 meters) from other people.
    Avoid dog parks or public places where a large number of people gather.
    Talk to your veterinarian if your pet gets sick or if you have any concerns about your pet's health.

- - "should i take ivermectin to treat covid-19?"
  - While there are approved uses for ivermectin in people and animals, it is not approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. You should not take any medicine to treat or prevent COVID-19 unless it has been prescribed to you by your health care provider and acquired from a legitimate source.

- - "what should i do if i came in contact with someone with covid?"
  - "After exposure to someone who has COVID-19, do the following:
    Call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline to find out where and when to get a test.
    Cooperate with contact-tracing procedures to stop the spread of the virus.
    If testing is not available, stay home and away from others for 14 days.
    While you are in quarantine, do not go to work, to school or to public places. Ask someone to bring you supplies.
    Keep at least a 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members.
    Wear a medical mask to protect others, including if/when you need to seek medical care.
    Clean your hands frequently.
    Stay in a separate room from other family members, and if not possible, wear a medical mask.
    Keep the room well-ventilated.
    If you share a room, place beds at least 1 metre apart.
    Monitor yourself for any symptoms for 14 days.
    Call your health care provider immediately if you have any of these danger signs: difficulty breathing, loss of speech or mobility, confusion or chest pain.
    Stay positive by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising at home."

- - "can children become sick with covid?"
  - "Children can be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 and can get sick with COVID-19. Most children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms or they may have no symptoms at all (“asymptomatic”). Fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults. However, children with certain underlying medical conditions and infants (less than 1 year old) might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Some children have developed a rare but serious disease that is linked to COVID-19 called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C)."

- - "is there a test for covid?"
  - "Some tests are used to diagnose the virus that causes COVID-19 infection whereas other tests are used to detect a recent or prior COVID-19 infection. There are 2 different types of COVID-19 diagnostic tests -- molecular tests and antigen tests. Molecular tests detect the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. Antigen tests detect specific proteins made by the virus. Tests that detect recent or prior COVID-19 infection are called antibody or serology tests. The EUAs allow the emergency use of tests during the COVID-19 emergency when the FDA determines certain criteria are met. These criteria include that the test may be effective at diagnosing COVID-19 and that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks."
